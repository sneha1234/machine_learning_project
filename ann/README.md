Backpropagation algorithm
=========================

To run first convert training and test data to numeric values.
You can first run `python convert.py /path/to/train.csv /path/to/test.csv`
Two files will be generated **train_conv.txt** and **test_conv.txt**

Then run:

`python bpnn.py train_conv.txt test_conv.txt`

Feel free to modify the source to suit your needs.
