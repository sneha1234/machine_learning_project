trainedData.csv -- contains normalized training data-- full data
testdata.csv -- contains normalized test data--100 records

knn.py --- uses above to files to compute knn algorithm.

results.csv --- contains result of the knn algorithm.
(results.csv already has the results as I ran the knn algorithm once).

Command to run the algorithm ---- python knn.py
and results will be appended to results.csv

Scripts new2.py and preprocess1.py are for normalizing training and test data to produce 
files trainedData.csv and testdata.csv.Donot run these again. It has to be done only once.
I have done it already and produced 
the above files.
